Running the Expo App

To start an Expo app in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you can follow these steps:

    Open VSCode and navigate to the folder where your Expo app is located. You should see the project files in the VSCode Explorer panel.

    Open a new terminal in VSCode by going to View -> Terminal or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+ (Backtick).

    In the terminal, ensure that you have Expo CLI installed globally by running the following command:

npm install -g expo-cli

If you already have Expo CLI installed, you can skip this step.

Change the directory to your Expo app folder by using the cd command in the terminal. For example:

bash

cd path/to/your/expo/app

Once you are in the correct directory, start the Expo development server by running the following command:

sql

expo start

This will launch the Expo Metro Bundler, which is a development server for your Expo app.

To run a Node.js server, you can follow these steps:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the server.js file is located.

    In the terminal, run the following command to start the Node.js server:

bash

node server.js

psql -U postgres
